<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Injection Molding Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Runner</li><li>Hot Runner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Injection Molding market is categorized into two main types: cold runner and hot runner systems. Cold runner systems use a channel to transport molten plastic to the mold, solidifying in the process, which can lead to material waste but is cost-effective for low-volume production. In contrast, hot runner systems maintain the plastic in a molten state, enhancing efficiency and reducing waste, making them ideal for high-volume production and complex parts. Both systems are crucial in the medical device manufacturing industry.</p></p>
