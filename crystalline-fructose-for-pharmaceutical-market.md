<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crystalline Fructose for Pharmaceutical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Starch Hydrolysis</li><li>Sucrose Hydrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crystalline fructose is a high-purity sweetener derived from the hydrolysis of starch or sucrose. In the starch hydrolysis market, enzymes break down starch into simpler sugars, primarily glucose, which can then be further processed to extract fructose. In the sucrose hydrolysis market, sucrose is enzymatically converted into glucose and fructose. Both methods produce crystalline fructose, commonly used in pharmaceuticals for its sweetness, stability, and low-caloric properties, enhancing formulations and masking unpleasant tastes in medications.</p></p>
